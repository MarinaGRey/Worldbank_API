# World Bank Data Analysis Project

This project was done in the subject 'Web analytics' in collaboration with the students named in the notebook file.

## Overview

This project involves analyzing various datasets provided by the World Bank. The analysis covers topics such as:

- Population statistics of countries worldwide, including comparisons between men and women.
- CO2 emissions data per capita for different countries.

The project consists of multiple tasks aimed at deriving insights from the datasets, including identifying the countries with the highest and lowest populations, and comparing gender population distributions. Additionally, it analyzes CO2 emissions per capita across countries.
